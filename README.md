## ✨ Features

### ★ SuperGrok Logo

Replaces the default Grok greeting logo with the SuperGrok logo.



### 🛠️ DeMod (Moderation Bypass)

Intercepts Grok's fetch and WebSocket responses and strips moderation flags before they reach the UI. Includes content recovery for hard-blocked responses.

**Status indicators shown in the settings panel:**

| Status        | Meaning                                                                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🟢 Safe       | Response passed through clean — no flags detected                       |
| 🟠 Flagged    | Response had soft flags (e.g. `isFlagged: true`) — DeMod stripped them  |
| 🔴 Blocked    | Response was hard-blocked — DeMod attempted to recover the real content |
| 🟡 Recovering | Currently re-fetching blocked content                                   |

---

### 🕑 Rate Limit Display

Injects a live counter into the Grok query bar showing your remaining queries and reset time for the current model. Updates automatically and includes a countdown timer when you're rate limited.

---

### 🗑️ Bulk Deleter

Adds **Delete All** buttons to multiple Grok pages for quick bulk cleanup:

| Page                     | What it deletes                               |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `/files`                 | All uploaded files and assets                 |
| `/share-links`           | All shared conversation links                 |
| `/deleted-conversations` | Permanently deletes all trashed conversations |

Each button matches Grok's native styling and shows a confirmation dialog before proceeding. Also adds a **Restore All** button on the deleted-conversations page.

---

### 🚫 Hide Popups

Automatically dismisses Grok's satisfaction survey popups, "Think Harder/Quick Response", suggestion popups, and more so they don't interrupt your workflow.

---

### 💎 Hide Premium Upsells

Hides all SuperGrok upgrade prompts and upsell banners across the entire interface — including the sidebar badge, header upgrade button, model menu upsells, "Upgrade plan" menu items, inline banners, and any upgrade dialogs/overlays.

---

### 🏋️ Hide Heavy Model

Hides the "Heavy" model option from the model selector dropdown. CSS-only, zero overhead — only activates when a model menu is open.

---

### 🔒 Auto Private Chat

In enabled, automatically enables private chat mode when you open Grok.

---

### ↕️ Disable Auto Scroll

Stops Grok from automatically scrolling to the bottom as responses stream in, letting you read at your own pace without losing your position.

---

### 🔞 Streamer Mode

Automatically hides conversations with sensitive names from both the sidebar and the "See all" menu as well. Matching chats are completely hidden (not blurred) — they are **not deleted**, just visually removed while Streamer Mode is enabled. Turning it off restores them instantly.

**Categories detected:**

- **NSFW / Sexual** — explicit terms, porn site names, kink/fetish terms, etc.
- **Personal / Medical** — STDs, pregnancy, addiction, mental health, suicide, self-harm
- **Abuse / Assault** — domestic abuse, sexual assault, harassment, stalking, etc.
- **Drugs** — recreational drugs, vaping, smoking
- **Legal** — lawsuits, attorneys, court, felonies, arrest, legality
- **Guns / Ammo / Self-Defense** — firearms, calibers, ammo types, concealed/open carry, specific brands
- **Bladed & Melee Weapons** — knives, swords, machetes, switchblades, daggers, bayonets, nunchucks, and similar
- **Archery & Projectiles** — bows, crossbows, slingshots, blowguns
- **Less-Lethal Tools** — tasers, stun guns, pepper spray, batons, kubotans


Uses a single pre-compiled regex for performance — no lag even with hundreds of sidebar items.

### 💡 Imagine Menu

A dedicated floating panel for Grok's `/imagine` video and image generation — activated by the **💡 button** that appears near the main settings FAB.

| Option                       | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Enabled / Disabled**       | Master toggle for all Imagine Menu interception                                                                                                                       |
| **Extend Video Length**      | Bypass the extend-video-length limit (1–30 seconds) — injected into each chat POST request before it's sent                                                           |
| **Auto-Retry on Moderation** | Automatically re-submits the prompt when Grok flags or blocks a generation                                                                                            |
| **Smart Retry**              | On each retry, rewrites the prompt using a different obfuscation strategy (leet speak, zero-width character insertion, synonym swaps) to slip past moderation filters |
| **Persistent Prompt**        | Saves your last prompt before every retry — if Grok clears the input box after a block, the prompt is automatically restored                                          |
| **Max Retries**              | How many times Auto-Retry will attempt before giving up (1–20)                                                                                                        |
| **Disable Video Loop**       | Stops generated videos from auto-looping when playback finishes                                                                                                       |
| **Hide Overlay Controls**    | Hides the control overlay that appears over generated videos                                                                                                          |
| **Prompts → Manage**         | Opens the Prompt Manager dialog to save, activate, and inject stored prompts into every generation request                                                            |

A live **status line** inside the panel shows interception count, retry progress, and the currently active saved prompt.

---

### 🎨 Custom Response Styles

Create and manage custom response style instructions that get prepended to your messages. When a style is active, its instructions are injected into every chat POST request, telling Grok how to respond.

- **Manage** button in the settings panel opens a dialog to add, edit, delete, and activate/deactivate styles
- Styles are stored in `localStorage` and persist across sessions
- Active style instructions are prepended to the user message field via fetch interception

---

### 📥 Media Downloader

Intercepts Grok's image and video API responses in the background and builds an in-memory lookup table of media URLs, filenames, prompts, and timestamps. Injects download buttons directly onto generated images and videos, and adds a **Mass Download** button on the `/imagine` favorites page.

- Downloads use the original HD URL where available
- Filenames include timestamp, model name, and prompt for easy organization
- Media database is automatically trimmed after 2,000 entries to prevent memory growth in long sessions

---

### 🔗 Clickable Links

Automatically converts URLs, domain names (including subdomains like `clips.twitch.tv` or `sub.site.com`), and `@mentions` in Grok responses into clickable links.

- Links appear **blue** by default and turn **purple** after you've visited them — just like a search engine
- Full subdomain support — the entire `subdomain.domain.tld` is captured, not just the root

**Smart @mention routing** — detects the nearest platform keyword (within ~150 characters of the `@mention`) and routes to the correct profile URL. Multiple platforms in the same message don't interfere with each other.

**Supported platforms**

| Detected keyword      | Links to                     |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| instagram / insta     | `instagram.com/user`         |

## 🔧 Technical Details

- **Run-at:** `document-start` — starts intercepting before any content loads
- **No external dependencies** — pure vanilla JS, no jQuery or library downloads
- **GM APIs used:** `GM_xmlhttpRequest` (binary downloads), `unsafeWindow` (fetch/WebSocket interception)
- **SPA-aware:** Monitors URL changes to re-apply features across Grok's single-page navigation
- **Settings** are stored in `localStorage` under `GrokEnhancer_*` keys — local only, never synced
- **In-memory caches** (e.g. media database) are session-only and cleared on page refresh

---

## 🔏 Privacy

This script runs entirely in your browser — no data is sent anywhere by the script itself.

- **No analytics or telemetry** of any kind
- **No external requests** — all network calls go to grok.com's own API (same as normal usage)
- **DeMod** reads Grok's API responses in-memory to strip moderation flags; response content is never logged or transmitted
- **Custom Styles** only modifies outgoing request bodies locally — no external server involved
- The `@grant unsafeWindow` permission is required solely to intercept fetch/WebSocket for DeMod, Custom Styles, and the Media Downloader
